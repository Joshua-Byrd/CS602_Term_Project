## Setup

1. In a terminal, navigate to the main folder and run

```
npm install
```

to install all necessary modules.

2. Make sure that MongoDB is installed and the MongoDB daemon is running in the background.

3. Run the seed.js file like so:

```
node seed.js
```

This will create and populate the database with books, authors, and users.
